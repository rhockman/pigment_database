# Pigment Scraper

This simple Python script goes through the Artist Watercolor section of Dick Blick and extracts the pigments used in each watercolor.

The output is visible on pigments.json.  There's also a bit of code that jams it all into a SQLite DB.

# HTML Builder

This turns the results into HTML that is hosted [on my website](https://hockman.org/pigments/index.html).
